I am thinking of doing a project for storing car information,
 for example: how many cars they owned, The model, year, make of the car
 how much they bought it for how much mileage was it when they bought
  how much mileage was it when they sold
 how much was the carsold for.
 Their VIN and plate number. 
All being stored in a database where user will have option to delete and update.
I am going to create  this project by myself so i will have to get everything done in a time.
